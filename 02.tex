We saw that the Riemann surface $\Gamma_{p(z)}$ is homeomorphic to $\bbc$.

We can generalize the previous constructions to studying graphs of
\begin{align*}
  p(z) &= w^p \\
  p(z,w) &= 0
\end{align*}
But before we do this, we need to make one more leap which is again inspired from topology.

The surface $\Gamma_{p(z)}$ costructed above is not compact.
Non-compact objects are harder\footnote{In most case, but of course not always.} to study than compact ones because the behaviour of limits is harder to control for non-compact surfaces and functions on non-compact .
\begin{qbox}(Optional exercise)
  Let $X$ be a subset of $\bbc$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that if $X$ is compact then every function $f:X \rightarrow \bbr$ is bounded.
    \item If $X$ is open, find an unbounded continuous function $f:X \rightarrow \bbc$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{qbox}
Furthermore, non-compact subsets come in all shapes and sizes (for example, every open subset of $\bbc$ is non-compact) but as we'll see in the next section there are various classification theorems for compact ones.
